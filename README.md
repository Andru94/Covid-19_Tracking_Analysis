# Covid-19_Tracking_Analysis
Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, I had a hard time keeping up to date with the pandemic's numbers across US states and other countries. I also had a hard time using existing visualizations and datasets to contextualize the rate at which the data was increasing. In order to build context around these numbers, I decided to utilize my Python skills to pull data from credible sources, create visualizations, and compute my own custom variables to track. I also computed linear regressions of the data to create projections for future numbers.  My main source for data was the covidtracking.com API (no longer updated since 3/7/2021) for US data and the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering COVID-19 repository for other countries.
